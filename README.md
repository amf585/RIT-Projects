# RIT-Projects
Some screenshots and code from various projects I worked on as a Human-Computer Interaction MS student at RIT

** Please Note - Due to many of these courses/projects still being offered I limited the amount of code posted here and focused more on screens / prototypes / mockups for the majority of them.
